    For our pilot issue, Richard Webb of Swampdog and Betterfish explains what irks him about the Australian seafood Industry. Luke Burgess of Garagiste invited us to a day at his Tasmanian restaurant and explained just how important wine is to his life in food. We sat through a rant by Cup Coffee proprietor, Josh Russell regarding the importance of arrogance, while our own editor-in-chief offers a taste of how much can be learnt when travelling through food saturated Gascony.

    The Producers issue tackles the beginning of the food chain. Emma-Kate Rose and Robert Pekin ask the question, ‘Why do farmers eat shit?’. Greg Clarke of Great Ocean Ducks explains the price of ducks and how he came to be called GOD. In the King Valley, Prosecco rules, and its champions, the Dal Zotto family, invite us into their home.

We re-visit Josh Russel of Cup Coffee on his return from a buying trip to Guatemala and El Salvador, and Sam Pendergast of Fair Ferments explains how good things can still be made when big business abandons our regional growers.
