    So where’s our local catch? In the case of our local mackerel I was chatting to a fisherman in the market the other day and the conversation went something like this. ‘Mate, I only send my fish to the local market if I get less than 100 kilos and it’s not worth my while sending it south; Melbourne and Sydney will pay more.’ The situation is even worse than that. If the market price crashes down there, then guess what—those fish are just as likely to get put on a truck and sent back up here to try and get a better price. The situation is ludicrous.

    It’s as if we have been duped into believing our fish from nearby are somewhat under par. Mackerel is the perfect example. There is a public misconception that mackerel is a dark, oily and ‘fishy’ tasting fish. This is true if you live in Victoria or Tassie because your local blue mackerel is like that (very similar to the atlantic variety of the northern hemisphere). Mackerel from Queensland, however, (grey, school, spotted and spanish) are white fleshed and mild in taste. Sometimes these kinds of false understandings make me wonder if there is in fact some kind of conspiracy going on.

    The truth is that in Queensland we have countless excellent eating fish: mackerels, wahoo, cobia, bonito, mulloway and threadfin are just a few. There are even species of mullet that are eminently suitable for even the very best of menus. By and large, however, these fish are caught by local small-scale fishermen and that usually represents a more sustainable outcome. To me our current preferences for ‘foreign’ fish represent some kind of cultural cringe where we believe our own local fish are somehow not ever as good as everyone else’s.

    Gascony is famed for prunes, armagnac, and floc, a kind of fortified aperitif. It is spiked with local armagnac and flows freely anytime after 4 o’clock in the afternoon, if you decide to wait that long. But there is not only drinking to be done, there are also grain crops, apples, strawberries, ducks for foie gras and magret and naturally there are vines. But most of all, in the Lot-et-Garonne, the fertile valley sandwiched roughly between the Lot and the Garonne rivers, there exist pigs and because of that, there is charcuterie. It is this that I have travelled all this way here to experience.

    Dominique Chapolard has become somewhat of a figurehead for Gascon charcuterie but it is his moustache that you notice first. Sizeable by anyone’s standards, it defines his character and appearance as gentle but proud. When he speaks, however, this impression is overwhelmed by his commanding knowledge and skill when it comes to pork. He is a teacher turned butcher, and part owner of the __GAEC des Landes de Baradieu__—the farm of the family Chapolard. Together with Kate, they are my charcuterie guides for one month as I am led through Kate’s program of understanding the lifecycle of this fine animal from the seed to sausage, as she would say.

    The simple-in-concept, and entirely holistic Chapolard production sees Dominique, his wife Christione and his brothers maintain this medium sized pig farm with apparently seamless ease. They are all in for equal pain and pleasure, raising pigs, and growing feverol, wheat and corn to feed them. Dominique clearly takes charge of the butchery and Christione champions the four markets they attend each week with her husband proudly by her side. If the work needs to get done, never will you see any one of them shy to get their hands dirty in one of the others’ business.

    Taking lead and instruction in equal part hand signals, French and Dominique’s often hilariously broken English, working alongside this family of pig farmers, butchers and charcutiers quickly impresses on me how strong albeit delicately balanced their work and personal lives have to be. Dominique shows me how to bone out hams and shoulders, working many times faster than my own attempts. He gladly shows me the secrets behind boudin noir, pâté de tête, saucisson and saucisses sèches. I am told that Christione is in charge of making fricandeaux and so naturally I pay extra attention when I see her disappear into the butchery kitchen to prepare these between tasks.

    After merely two days per week over the month, their expertise has clearly worn off on me as I find myself suddenly able to bone out and butcher a 100kg half carcass within the hour. These pigs are by far the largest I have ever worked with. My achievements, however, are dwarfed by the rest of their family as they complete the tasks in a fraction of the time. Their skill and their attitude to their work is impressive. I find myself in awe of how natural even their most junior of staff appear around the production.

  copy: "The basic model of the food chain in Australia is this: Trucks bring good
    food from all over the country and the globe into the central markets of capital
    cities to be collated; it arrives safely, is repacked onto different trucks but
    with all the best parts picked out by the city; it travels back to the regions
    it came from and back into their local shops.\n\nNot only is this system wasteful,
    inconsiderate to the effects of transport—energy cost and food waste—but it is
    clearly insanity in a very pure form. I’m not just talking fresh fruit and vegetables,
    I’m talking about everyday groceries as well. For example, when I was last in
    Kingaroy, the peanut capital of Australia, I could not find one pub or shop that
    sold locally grown peanuts. This town is famous for its landmark peanut van, sitting
    on the edge of town selling all varieties of freshly roasted, delicious local
    peanuts. But once in town, the best you you are going to get is a stale packet
    of Nobbys Nuts. It’s bloody unreal.\n\nTo the contrary to the current system,
    I reckon it should be the capital cities that only get the bad food—the rancid
    flours, out of date rolled oats and all the stale peanuts. We shouldn’t forget
    that it was the city planners who decided to grow houses and highways on top of
    our best soils, completely neglecting our need for food growth. It was them that
    in turn caused our farms to move further and further from the city. As a result,
    with demand from the cities not falling, we are now at a point where our food
    producing regions cannot even access the majority of their own food. Our 'advanced
    society' currently takes longer to transport food to regional areas than it did
    100 years ago—clearly there is a serious problem.\n\nYou could ask why do farmers
    need to eat good food? But this seems ridiculous. Apart from the fact that good
    food helps us physically, it’s equally important for keeping the mind functioning
    in top gear. It might surprise a lot of folk but farmers, and more so good ecological
    farmers, are some of the most intelligent people on earth. I don’t say this because
    \ I am a former ecological farmer, or because I like to piss in farmers’ pockets.
    Rather, I’m saying this from experience. I was an engineer for 11 years and whilst
    engineering did require some intellectual strain, it was very narrow. Physics,
    mechanics, mathematics, a bit of chemistry. Farming however requires much more
    intellectual rigour across a much broader spectrum.\n\nEven ignoring the things
    that they cannot control—the weather, the farm-gate price, and what ‘moron’ politician
    gets voted in by the claimed majority—they are forced to wear many hats. Farmers
    are soil microbiologists, animal husbandry specialists, midwives, mechanics, economists,
    engineers, counsellors, geologists, ecologists, arborists, managers, accountants,
    horticulturalists, marketers, fencers and labourers...just to name a few. Then
    also they are forced to manage farm purchases and spending, almost always with
    a bank manager looking over their shoulders. You’d really have to be a mug (to
    want to do it). \n"

  copy: "Having run my own CSA* in Tasmania growing 70 odd varieties of fruit and
    vegetables, the thought had never occurred to me before, but the many organic
    farmers, those who are growing only one or two varieties of crops, have a pretty
    shit diet. Back in 2004, I was visiting Neil Cook’s farm—a Biodynamic grower on
    the Granite Belt. It was the second visit I’d made to Neil’s farm, I was racing
    around South East Queensland rounding up producers for __Food Connect__, our new
    food box distribution scheme based out of Brisbane. He casually asked me if I
    could bring some food for him next time I visited. His simple question took me
    by surprise, I thought to myself, hang on, doesn’t this place grow a heap of really
    good food?—I turned around and I asked, ‘whaddya mean’?\n\n‘Can you bring us up
    some veggies, you’re dealing with all the best organic farmers in the region—we
    eat shit up here. I’ve got good apples growing here that I eat, but that’s about
    it. I grow a few pears as well, and there are some good farmers doing nectarines...but
    what about the rest of my diet? The shops here don’t stock quality stuff and certainly
    not biodynamic or organic’, said Neil. \n\nThat was 10 years ago and times haven’t
    changed a lot since then. There are a lot more farmers involved in ecological
    agriculture now and the barriers of accessing good food are thankfully somewhat
    less but on the whole, most farmers are at the end of the food chain. Not only
    are they forced to take terrible prices for their product but this applies to
    the food that is offered to them in their local shops as well."

    Everyone I know has a food they dislike and I can very confidently say everyone you know has a food or even foods they aren’t so fond of, simply don’t like, or maybe even detest. But if you think about whatever food this happens to be, I can guarantee you that there is someone else in the world who loves it, and couldn’t dream of being apart from it.

    Do we call this dislike ignorance? Or simply unfamiliarity? In my experience, and I am sure many of your own, often all that is needed is only one particularly bad experience.

    Whatever it is that causes it, the resulting unfortunate mindset leads to a situation where food that has been misunderstood becomes largely ignored. Be it amongst your family, your friendship group or an entire cultural paradigm, these perpetuating misunderstandings can be so damaging.

    To be clear, I am not mouthing off at diversity. What I refer to here is an unwillingness to understand the value of our increasingly scarce food supply. A food supply of which the venerable hogget is indeed part.

    Prosecco and the King Valley: The heritage of the Prosecco wine dates back to the Roman Empire, when it was known as Pucino. Today it’s principally grown in the hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene in the moderate Mediterranean climate of the Veneto region of Northern Italy. In recent years the drink has outgrown its global reputation as cheap fizz, and is becoming a cool, relaxed celebratory drink, served at ritzy events in a salute to Italy’s stylish culture. It’s an uncomplicated wine, and its refreshing nature is perfect for Australian drinking conditions.

    While not as mountainous, the King Valley, 250km north west of Melbourne, enjoys a similar climate to that of Veneto—frosty winters, and hot dry summers. The area’s agricultural past means the land is primed for growing, and Australian wine giants Brown Brothers began planting a range of varietals in the area in the 1970s. By the time Otto was ready to start producing, some 20 years later, the region was firmly established as wine growing country. Planting Prosecco however, hadn’t yet crossed anyone else’s mind.

    ‘I was lucky enough to find a guy in South Australia, that had brought in a couple of plants of Prosecco over from Italy’, explains Otto.

    ‘He wasn’t giving it to anyone, but I spoke to him on the phone, and we got chatting in our local Italian dialect of Valdobbiadene, I told him I was born in the Prosecco country, and he was nice enough to give me a few buds. We confirmed the DNA and we did bit of propagation—it took from 1999 and 2004 to get the first bottle, which we did in the Champenoise style’.

    Méthode Champenoise, is a labour intensive, traditional winemaking craft, today only used commercially with Champagne’s and other high-end sparkling wines. It is however, the only viable option for a start-up with limited resources, and was the only method available to Otto in his Prosecco venture’s early days. Despite authentic intentions behind Otto’s Prosecco, it was a massive business gamble. Not only was he creating a new product in Australia, he was also backing a wine that wasn’t particularly popular. By 2004, two of Otto’s sons had left their careers behind to help create this family venture, so when it came to uncorking that first bottle, the new winemaker had a lot of pressure on his shoulders.

    ‘I tell you what, we were sitting here at this table, and I was very nervous’, he recalls. ‘I was very worried about it, because we didn’t know what was going to happen, we didn’t know if it was going to be very good. The expectation was so high, and if it didn’t reach that, to me, it was going to be a failure’. ‘When we opened a bottle and tasted it I said ‘wow, thank god it’s good’ — I really went ‘wow’’.

    Otto christened the wine Dal Zotto L’Immigrante Prosecco.

    Brother-sister duo Jasper and Sophie Button have been making wine under the label Commune of Buttons since 2013. However, their connection to viticulture stretches back decades, with their parents instrumental in establishing Basket Range as a prominent wine region. They planted out vines in the 1990s, when the farm was owned by a commune of three families, and sold the grapes to commercial wineries to make a modest living. Now the next generation has taken the lead, converting to organic practices and co-farming the majority of the 30 acres with Anton of Lucy Margaux Vineyards.

    Jasper says the Australian industry has a long way to go in understanding the importance between a vineyard’s work in cultivating grapes and the wine those grapes produce. “For whatever reason, it’s a novel concept in Australia that you can grow your own grapes and make your own wine. That’s not something that people seem to think they are capable of achieving.” He says it’s both hard work and thoroughly interesting to get to the point of understanding what a vineyard is doing and how to turn that into really delicious wine. “The world around us needs always to have evolving methods that take from the past and give to the future,” Sophie adds. “It’s within our nature to push boundaries, question techniques and enjoy the fruits of experimentation—we just happen to do that with wine. The relationship of the farmer and winemaker will always be for the individual to question. For what we do, it makes sense to take control of what we can, as there are so many uncontrolled variables.”

    Anton believes that this style of winemaking requires an open and highly involved connection with the vineyard. “If you don’t have an intimate relationship with your vineyard, whether you’re buying the fruit or not, I would say that’s not natural wine. You can’t just buy organic fruit and not add anything to it. So it’s integral to the method that we make.” Jasper agrees that connection is vital in small production. “If you want to take it seriously, you have to have a hand in each of the processes.” James intentionally acknowledges his viticulturist Fiona Wood among his labelling to encourage recognition for the pivotal role growers play in shaping the final vintage. “Fiona is integral. It’s her energy and ideology that goes into the farming. For me, that’s what creates a very unique starting point. There’s simply just no recognition in Australia for growers,” he says.

    This highly attentive, hands-on practice validates that minimal intervention doesn’t mean minimal involvement. This progressive cohort are not championing minimal intervention wine because they don’t want to be involved. Rather, it’s the opposite. They’re creating challenges for themselves that any sensible winemaker wouldn’t create for themselves. This approach is also demonstrative of how far we’ve diverged from ancient winemaking. Somewhere along the line we thought we needed to make artificial additions at both the viticulture and vinification stages to control the end product. “When we started out, the idea of not adding acid was huge; the idea of not adding sulfur was impossible; the idea of selling wine to the French was crazy. The paradigm has been smashed,” James says. It’s an anxiety-inducing experiment, where precision is applied to picking time, while ferments are left to nature’s chosen direction and a little bit of oxygen can dramatically alter a wine’s intended course. “You can control the growing to an extent, but when you’re making wine without additions, you’ve just got to guide it along. You can’t control it sometimes,” Gareth explains.

    Call it unjust, ill-judged or harsh, but a young ram or ewe just celebrating its first birthday finds his or herself bound by prejudice. At age one, this animal—often manifested in cartoons or similarly celebrated as a child’s play toy; an undeniably cute bundle of soft fluffy love—undergoes some changes.

    Call it Ovis Aries puberty, except in this instance the changes are marginally physical. As its muscles age, strengthen and increase in size, they become denser and more worked. As is generally accepted with all animals, they can present a more pungent odour and stronger flavour when cooked.

    Physically, this is about as severe as it gets, and these changes do not occur overnight. Baby baa baa at age 12 months is in fact no less adorable than when roaming the grassy paddocks at age 11 months and 30 days, and the same can be said about his or her meat. Under Australian meat classification* however, this calls for a name change, individual branding (the animal is then branded with a symbol of two-teeth), and, due to our yearning for the meat which is named lamb, a dramatically lower price at market.

    Prosecco road: While combining authenticity with innovation has been essential in the success of Dal Zotto, the brand’s work in putting King Valley on the map as a unique wine growing region has been something else entirely. It was Christian who spearheaded the Prosecco Road concept, which has seen tourists arrive in droves to the remote region, dramatically boosting the profiles of the area’s smaller producers. Tourism Australia’s backing of the idea has helped this significantly, and Dal Zotto has worked closely with Government and Virgin Airlines to maximise exposure for the region.

    ‘It was easy to get the other winemakers on board, because we all needed something that brought us together and allowed us to market the region together’, Christian explains.

    ‘Sure we’re going to fight for the end-customer, but we all need them. It just showed that a bottle of wine can bring people together and that people were willing to have a bit of fun and do something that is not so serious in the wine industry and try and make a bit of money’.

    ‘I feel that Australia as a whole has been pretty proactive in reshaping how marketing is done in the wine world.’ Some may see a lack of tradition as a disadvantage, but in Australia’s comparatively new wine industry it has allowed its brands to be completely innovative. In turn this allows new producers to quickly entice new consumers to its products. Dal Zotto’s success has been testament to this and Otto believes that the quality of production here rivals the world’s best. In recent years he has even battled industry bodies in Italy so he can officially use the name ‘Prosecco’ on his wine. It’s now ten years after Otto’s first bottle of L’Immigrante Prosecco was uncorked, and although he and his sons are still refining their craft, they believe they are producing a Prosecco as good as anything you’ll find back where their roots extend in the Veneto region.

    When recently speaking to a circle of butchers, friends and, I am ashamed to say, even some chefs, many words were being thrown about; 'shit lamb' was among the kinder ones. If you were to believe this commonly expressed feeling amongst the populace, the edibility of meat would seem to be something to be questioned.

    Were you to judge hogget simply on these typical reactions you may be convinced that eating newly gentrified lamb could in fact leave you stricken with a myriad of disheartening diseases or perhaps some unqiue form of fungal growth. If you are sitting there thinking, I’m not down with eating this animal either, I hate to say it but you may be struggling with a minor case of gastronomic ignorance.

    While this will sounds like a fairly loose connection at first, there is a way to solve this by talking about the inarguable ties between sensuality, pleasure, sexuality and the raw human need to satisfy an innate will for the consumption of food.

  copy: I referred to Dirk as a winemaker for years. I think in the beginning he probably
    thought that was exactly what his new job description would be, but things have
    certainly changed. The distinction between winemaker and farmer is quite clear,
    in some places. The former carries much more prestige, interest and financial
    rewards, but what if they were intertwined and one and the same? How can a farmer
    be a winemaker? I never thought of grapes for wine as a crop and many people don’t.
    From that desire to experience the River Cottage closer to home, I discovered
    that not only did I want to meet the people who grew my food, but those who grew
    the fruit to make the wine I was consuming with that food.

    Serendipitously, we commenced this planning just as we found an accommodating and enterprising butcher to see us through until we could realise our on-farm dream. Additionally, he even agreed to my madcap suggestion that he might let me cut with him each fortnight to learn the trade. The first night I turned up and asked for a boning knife, Sal asked with serious doubt in his voice, ‘Are you really going to cut with me?’

    I realised then that he didn’t actually believe I was serious about wanting to learn, but when Sal saw me don the apron, he quickly adjusted his expectations and settled in to the task of teaching me how to break down a carcass with minimal waste. We would always cut after a full day’s work; this was the major reason why it was so hard to find a willing butcher, as their own retail businesses operate six or seven days each week. An intense six months of fortnightly butchering followed as I learnt slowly each and every cut of the pig. At the other end, I came out not only a competent meatsmith, but with a profound respect for the skill and strength of those in the trade.

  copy: There is an incredible energy to this place and its people. The charm and
    enthusiasm of its winemaking inhabitants is infectious, and leaves travellers
    who were merely passing through, or distant friends simply visiting for a weekend,
    quickly plotting a longer stay. This magnetism draws to mind the romantic narratives
    of Masanobu Fukuoka’s organic farming commune. The farmer and philosopher wrote
    the 1975 manifesto on a return to natural farming in Japan, and city-weary, farm-curious
    folk would pilgrimage to his plot in Shikoku in search of peace, understanding
    and a nature-bound life. Similarly, inquisitive and conscious-of-mind visitors
    quickly catch the Basket Range bug. And the Basket Range swiftly and affectionately
    absorbs these newcomers into the folds of its welcoming community. Anton van Klopper
    of Lucy Margaux Vineyards was one of the original renegade thinkers on the range.
    He took the early blows and paved the way for others to follow. He’s kind of like
    The Godfather of the collective. It was through Anton that James Erskine came
    to establish Jauma. “Anton was the original person up in the region who started
    to promote this culture of challenging the paradigm. You need a certain type of
    personality to be able to have a crack at things and stand up in front of other
    people and believe in yourself, and he certainly inspired me in many ways,” James
    says. A lauded sommelier, with a degree in soil chemistry, James had been hanging
    up in the hills with Anton for two years while consulting at a winery at Woodside
    when he realised he had all the skills he needed to give winemaking a right hard
    crack. “Anton was very generous and said, ‘Look, in the first year there’s going
    to be a hell of a lot of outlay. Why don’t you just use my equipment? Your rent
    can be that you can help me’. It got me off the ground basically,” James says.
    That openness and willingness to share knowledge and equipment was catching, with
    James paying this generosity forward, lending a hand to Gareth Belton of Gentle
    Folk Wines and Alex Schulkin of The Other Right. It’s this tutelage and support,
    as well as a shared belief in organic versus conventional food and farming, that
    saw this coterie of vanguardists decide to make wine with a light touch. “I really
    care about what planet we live on and what planet my children and my grandchildren
    are going to live on. The more we do now, the more we minimise the damage,” Alex
    says.

    Stumbling onto the platform from one of France’s famed TGV trains, sore eyes and backside are pretty far from my mind. It occurs to me just now that I am about to try and meet a lady who, while familiar over email, I have in fact only seen once months beforehand in a fleeting poorly connected Skype call. Even on my better days I would have questioned my ability to pick somebody out of a crowd like this.

    That is until you meet Kate Hill. Her now almost signature headband pops up above the other heads in the crowd and before I know it I find myself partaking in the standard French cheek kiss one-two, a practice I am to master before my time here is up. Kate’s generosity and warmth is immediate, and with an apparent sixth sense, she whisks me into a car and out of town to Camont, Kate’s incredible farmhouse in the nearby town of Sainte-Colombe-en-Bruilhois to experience my first dose of Gascon hospitality.

    Simple in every way but perfectly apt for the moment, a dish of braised beef and couscous. The beef I am told is from a friend nearby and I just have to try it; she is not wrong, it is exceptional. There are bay leaves added in the style of Gascony, fresh and in abundance, and chewing is almost unnecessary as each bite releases the grassy flavours of the land. It is comfort food on steroids and I could wish for nothing else. Two days of aeroplane food trays and perfectly packaged items since I left Melbourne, but here on the valley floor of the Lot-et-Garronne I quite rightly feel worlds from home. It is now close to nine o’clock in the evening, but the Gascon sun is still out and the rosé is flowing. While I don’t realise it yet, I have just stumbled into what I am sure will forever be one of my major food Meccas.

    Kate Hill is a cook, author, tour guide and canal boat owner, and this doesn’t scratch the surface of the stories she has to tell about what has been her culinary life so far. While she is my gracious host for the next month, she is only part of what I am here to see. Kate is to be my culinary proxy in Gascony, a translator, guide and mentor in all things regarding the finest of all animals: ‘le cochon’, the pig.

    Those who don’t live in the south of France often speak of the springtime here in such an idealised fashion, generally in a tone overflowing with jealousy of those who do. My first taste of this feeling was not to disappoint. It came the next morning when I woke in a grandiose farmhouse, the kind that one would always imagine exists here, to the kind of calm that can only be experienced in the country. There is sunshine, budding blossoms and the feel that is derived only from fertile lands re-awakening from the winter. Every direction you face, an indescribable freshness hits you and your eyes are filled with images of astoundingly beautiful things.

    It’s time to get over it. If you are a chef, go and develop a better relationship with your fishmonger. Tell them you want to learn more about your local fish. If issues like sustainability are important to you, then tell them. If you can’t trust them, find another one. When they tell you a fish is good, believe them—or at least give it a go. Make your menu more flexible so you can opportunistically take advantage of the best fish available. Make the effort to get to know your local produce.

    If you are a customer then open yourself up to trying new fish. Ask your waitstaff about them and where they come from. You may get a blank stare first of all, but switched-on waiters will only let that happen once. Most importantly, trust your chef—they are not going to sell you crap, it is their entire job to impress and satisfy you, and why wouldn’t they?

    It’s been over a year since my chat with James and since then I’ve learnt and am still learning a lot. In many ways Betterfish is a direct outcome of that phone call and my associated shortfall. I suppose I have now grown up a fair bit, and rather than directing my efforts towards berating chefs who do not provide a product in line with my views, I spend an increasing amount of time helping chefs all over to explore a wider range of seafood options, with a much more helpful and far less paternal outlook.

    I guess, at the end of the day, what I am really saying is—James, if you read this, I am sorry, give me a call, I promise this time I will be gentle.

    today. Taking on a homeless but harmless (albeit angry) ex-farmer was a brave
    move but it was all I needed to give me the confidence to have a good crack at
    my loopy idea. Over those 10 years we have seen increasing engagement in the food
    system. We have seen many new exciting alternatives to supermarkets, and it seems
    a new farmers market is opening every week and we’ve seen the growth of the fair
    food movement led by the Australian Food Sovereignty Alliance*. From where I sit,
    this increasing popularity only makes it more fun, not to mention the increased
    satisfaction of making a tangible difference. \n\nWe are still yet to see a mainstream
    awareness of our farmers still generally eating shit and taking crap. Maybe because
    farmers are a humble and resilient lot, but it can only go on for so long. Cracks
    in their armour are already starting to appear, and we can see evidence of this
    if we bother to look. It is expressed in the form of harm, self harm, harming
    families, harming animals or harming the land. When I was being offered 19 cents
    a litre for my milk as a dairy farmer many years ago, I took it out on my cows.
    I thought about taking it out on myself, but I was too gutless, so the cows took
    the brunt of my anger. I still sometimes have the occasional nightmare about these
    actions in my past. \n\nDestroying our rivers and streams, deforesting our wonderful
    forests en-mass. We gouge up the earth and spread all forms of chemicals around.
    This is all as a result of farmers being forced more and more to produce cheaper
    food, forced always to cut more corners to lower their costs. National supermarkets
    now sink so much money into keeping the public blind and even the celebrity chefs
    are called on to spread the supermarkets message to keep the public hooked on
    buying their food always cheaper and from anywhere.\n\nWe get all precious about
    the treatment of animals but do we stop to think about why that is, and how complicit
    we are in that treatment? Fuck me sideways, most people still go to the butcher
    and ask for lamb and pay $40 kg for it. Yet hogget and mutton are far tastier
    meats, ones that allow us to get away with less killing as a result. A two to
    three year old sheep has 4 times as much meat and a much stronger flavour so you
    need to eat much less. It’s only a bonus that you don’t have to kill a cuddly
    little lamb. \n\nDo we want to shake off our mindset and cultural cringe or whatever
    else it is stopping us from really being a part of a fairer food system, or are
    we going to keep the pretentiousness up, keep watching Masterchef, and not take
    the issue seriously? It’s not hard today, particularly here in Australia. I might
    have listened to the excuses 10 years ago, but not now. We are spoiled for choice
    to make a contribution. Do some thinking, take action and pay more for your food.
    Support your local, independent and ethical retailers and wholesalers, or start
    your own social enterprise. Get on the fair food train and have a blast, there
    are no regrets to be had.\n\nUrbanites especially have access to so many resources
    that keep them intellectually and culturally stimulated now, try turn them into
    something real. Offer something simple, like to help rebuild a farmer’s burnt
    down fence. Vow to reduce the amount of times you go into a supermarket. Say thank
    you to the person who grew your food. Play fair, help farmers eat well, help them
    receive your gratitude, and stop forcing them to eat shit.” — Rob"

    Russian-born Alex met his wife Galit while living in Israel. They decided to move to Australia so Alex could chase his fledgling passion for making wine, choosing the Basket Range because the only Australian they knew, James, was based there. Alex took his background in biophysics and tacked on an honours degree in oenology from the University of Adelaide, before landing a job at the Australian Wine Research Institute, where he’s currently looking into the chemical drivers of wine texture. He came at winemaking expecting to make conventional wine. “Very little of what we plan actually turns out the way we imagined it. But I’ve realised that if things don’t work out exactly the way they were planned, it’s not necessarily a bad thing. When we came to South Australia, I really didn’t know that natural wine existed. I always wanted to make exciting wine, because that’s what I felt wine was about,” he says. But his perception of what it means for wine to be exciting has shifted over the years. While The Other Right wines appear vibrant and playful, his scientific rearing has contributed to shaping his signature style. “If you want to break the rules, or even bend them, it’s worth knowing them. In certain ways, knowing the rules can make it challenging to bend them because you know you’re going against something. But given a bit of practice, you get used to it. And that is where we find excitement now.”

    Anton’s natural modus operandi is to question and break rules and systems. He too received first class honours at the University of Adelaide and made wine across various levels of convention and intervention for others in Germany, New Zealand and the United States. But he returned to the hills in 2002 and started experimenting. “I learnt so much at university and I’m so thankful for what I learnt, and I understand the concept, but it didn’t sit well with me. I couldn’t really find the answers in my study. So I went about disproving all the things that I was uncomfortable with. I didn’t really do it to prove a point; I just wanted to see what was possible. Once I started doing it, there was a little bit of backlash by some people, and a little bit of a following from others. Some that thought it was great to have freedom, and some that publicly berated what I was doing.” Anton is conscious that the holistic approach to wine and lifestyle that is a common thread amongst the Basket Range motley crew may induce a perception of hippy winemakers nesting in the hills, growing their own produce and living in accordance with nature’s rhythms. But these “crazy cats”, as Gareth dubs them, are at their core scientists and philosophers, critically questioning each other’s motivations and their liquid creations.

  copy: "Eating shit and taking crap is not much fun. No wonder we have a suicide
    problem in the regions. No wonder we have an ageing population on our farms—the
    average now reaching over 60. No wonder farmers’ children don’t want to stay on
    the farm, and no wonder our regional towns suffer social and economic hardship.
    All the while the real wealth of our nation’s cities, that which comes from the
    regions, is creeping further away from being understood or appreciated by our
    greater society.\n\nThe systemic failure of a corporatised, consolidated and centralised
    food system is far easier to comment on than to actually do anything about. Farmers’
    health continues to decline, with obesity rates in rural and regional Australia
    at record highs. \n\nI am reminded of a recent news article relating a decision
    of the Uniting Church to not distribute chocolate eggs this Easter. They were
    unable to source a slave-free chocolate, so they offered boiled lollies in replacement.
    Perhaps what the church failed to say was that they were unable to source a cheap
    source of slave-free chocolate—many options clearly do indeed exist. \n\nThis
    failure in thinking would be laughable were it not so serious. Everybody wants
    good, guilt-free food, but we've been conditioned to buy cheaply and are not easily
    persuaded otherwise. Likewise most would argue they want to live in a healthy
    environment, but they are not prepared to pay the farmers and fishermen enough
    to be able to look after their land and oceans. These unseen external costs of
    cheap food far outweigh the true costs for growing great food and in turn our
    farmers will suffer along with their land. "

    to earn the lefty-loopy-idealist badge these days, but some of us do wear it proudly

    We unfortunately only have time here for the last few years of this story. I’ll begin with the galvanising moment—June 2010—when my lifetime lover Stuart and I heard Joel Salatin of Polyface Farms speak at the Lake House in Daylesford, Victoria.

    Many of Salatin’s key points from that pivotal day are central to how we do business at Jonai Farms and Meatsmiths today: look after the ‘ecological umbilical’ through practices such as pasture-raised livestock in regenerative systems; take control of further processing on-farm and work for regulatory reform for small, low risk systems; ‘hold your innovations lightly’—no trademarks or patents; share what you learn in the interest of the public good; identify your market boundaries and then send people to other wonderful growers also selling ethical food; sell directly to people, and make sure ‘people answer the phone’; no advertising—it’s all word of mouth; ‘respect the pigness of the pig’ of course; and finally, we need more ‘Jeffersonian intellectual agrarians’!

  copy: Taras Ochota of Ochota Barrels is also classically trained, having studied
    oenology and worked for vineyards both locally and globally. But he’s also the
    punk of the gang—and it’s impossible to have a boring time when he’s around. He’s
    up to his 25th vintage—the past eight have been Ochota specific—and he says he’s
    becoming more and more relaxed as a winemaker. “It’s basically about working with
    Mother Nature and dodging the bullets that she fires. But the bottom line is always
    remembering it’s only a drink, not to take it too seriously and relax. I don’t
    work very hard during vintage. I like to finish early, have a cold beer, and go
    for a swim in the waterhole. If it can be done tomorrow, do it tomorrow.” Taras
    says that his wine is a product of his own personal tastes. And because his friends
    and family are first-hand imbibers of Ochota wines, growing organic grapes is
    key. “I grow my vegetables organically, so my son can go and pick a cherry tomato
    and put it in his mouth without having to worry about washing it. I take the same
    approach with our vineyards, not putting anything nasty on them.” Each maker of
    the region has a deep reverence for their entire surrounding ecosystem—the soil,
    the people, the grapes. It’s evident that the landscape, lifestyle and life ethics
    of the sub-region has played a role in shaping the mindsets, philosophies, methods,
    and resulting new-wave wines of these makers.

    Despite initial apprehensions Otto settled in well. In swift Italian fashion he met a wife, who would bear his four sons and his family lived a fine hybrid of the Australian and Italian way. He worked hard and soon owned a tobacco farm on a decent plot of land. Yet, despite this comfortable new life, something was missing, something ingrained in Otto from the home he left behind, and something he was not ready to forget. That something was Prosecco.

    ‘I grew up with Prosecco,’ explains Otto.

    47 years after his arrival, he is surveying his grape vines, which stretch out across the countryside before his family estate.

    ‘I had my first taste when I was four years old,’ he continues. ‘There’d always be a bottle of Prosecco on the table, it was very important. When we decided we wanted to make wine instead of growing tobacco my sons asked me what I wanted to do and the answer was easy—I wanted to grow Prosecco.’

    ‘In those days, you couldn’t find a decent Prosecco here in Australia, unless you were spending $100 a bottle. The cheaper Italian Prosecco was very bitter, with high acidity. I kept dreaming that I’d find something better, but nothing came along.’

    As you spend time in Gascony and you interact with its people, the unshakeable feeling that this could be the genesis of food culture is hard to ignore. From farms to markets, and from farmstead to homes, you meet people who are not fascinated by food in the way that modern foodies are. They are engrained in it, consumed by it and exist only because of it. It is a lifeblood, it is a holistic, bi-partisan relationship between producer and consumer where each takes and receives in beautiful equality.

    We as modern foodies are often consumed by the concepts of seasonality and locality to the point of fascination and fashion. But it is these Gascons who truly live it. The strawberries you bought at market came from a farm not two towns away, if that. And those strawberries themselves will appear and disappear around the springtime. They are watery when it rains, sweet when there is sun. And fool be you to make confiture early in the season, for it is known that you are only to use strawberries from the late season for jam.

    Lunch at __Le Table d’Armandie__ in Agen is foie gras, rillette de porc and lamproie, a regional jawless variety of fish that exists in the canals. Nearby they are serving confit de canard and pied de cochon and for dessert, and as it is that time of year you will be sure to find tarte aux fraises and pastis de gascon. You eat these things because they are what’s made here. In this part of the world, people don’t seem to yearn for delicate produce from regions far away; they are proud of what they have and as such are satisfied with it.

    I fairly regularly find myself in restaurants all over the world, but no matter how good these meals are, the cliché is true that the best food is always to be had when it is cooked by those who produced it. It is never the complexity that impresses, but the pride shown in simplicity. Dining at the home of Dominique and Christione Chapolard was exactly one of these moments. I am ashamed to say I cannot recall every meal Christione cooked for me, but I do remember that  each one of them was fantastic, and that will never leave me. There was the finest asperge blanc I have ever eaten, a basic moutarde vinaigrette and porc saucisse, roast porc and fricandeux from the farm. There was an ancient but intensely flavoured cock from behind the house whose time had finally come and I was even honoured with some rare and pricey local lamb that had been left over from Christmas celebrations past. The generosity and kindness in light of their busy lifestyle was second to none.

    People often speak of an arrogance amongst the French, though my time in Gascony makes me vehemently disagree; perhaps, if an attitude exists, it is one closer to pride that has been misconstrued by outsiders. While language is always a challenge for visitors, the rewards for your efforts in this part of the world are great. We would dine on pork roast not sold at market, or cheese made by friends in the Pyrenees and we would talk about food culture, farming and family. Most of all, though, in true French style we would talk politics over coffee and gateaux while we mimed and laughed together in a bizarre combination of languages and signs.

    I remember being asked by Dominque what it was that brought me here. By this time his frankness no longer caught me off guard, but it was the bewilderment that he offered along with it this time that did. While New World chefs and foodies have been travelling to the Old World for years, amongst locals, there is little understanding of why. Even after impressing on Dominique how important his kind of work is to people like me in the New World it was clear that while he felt honoured, he was perhaps still some way from truly realising why I was there.

    It is very easy to get caught up in the romance of this countryside, the towns of Agen, Nerac, Condom and Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port with their aged beauty only get more impressive as you follow the roads towards the Basque townships of Hasparren and the producers in the Pyrenees areas of Banca and Les Aldudes. The specialties vary, from noix de jambon, to the ancient secrets behind the garlic-heavy jambon de Tournon and further into the hills towards the famous ham country of the Ibaiona and Bayonne products. What stays the same, though, be it at the three-starred restaurant of Michel Guerard in __Les Prés d’Eugénie__ or from a salesmen at the Victor Hugo market in Toulouse is a mutual love for the product of their land. I don’t shy away from saying it once more: these people are loaded with pride. This is the country of true whole hog, a land where traditional methodology can be practised, methods that haven’t given way to ignorance or severe HACCP control. A world where names like __Ospital__, __Orteiza__ and the __Belaun Co-Op__ are kings. This is salt country, this is jambon country, this is for sure my newest food Mecca.

    After hearing Joel proselytise on the viability of small farms and our capacity to right the wrongs of industrial agriculture, we knew farming was our ticket out of the city and onto the land, where our bleeding hearts had been waiting since before we met. September 2011 we found ourselves on 69 stunning acres of rich volcanic soils, the proud custodians of the southern half of an old cinder-cone—our very own volcano. It just so happened that we were in spa country near where Joel Salatin had first impressed his message upon us in Daylesford.

    We started with six rare breed Large Black pigs, a dozen Lowline cattle, a flock of rare breed Lincoln sheep, a dog, a cat and a handful of chooks. Just over two years later, we run a full herd of around 120 pigs at any given time (12 sows and two boars) and have just begun breeding our own Lowlines.

    After the first hurdles of learning to care well for pigs and cattle, we faced our first serious roadblock—we were ready to have pigs slaughtered and butchered. The abattoir was a bit tricky—the closest one is over an hour away but their systems are of a high ethical standard. We are happy with their best-practice carbon dioxide stunning method and the minimal holding periods of the pigs. Luckily then, it is a worthwhile trip.

    It is butchering that is hands down the biggest supply chain issue small livestock producers face. Of the many retail butchers we approached as our pigs neared market weight, one was too busy to help, one was only sporadically available and then over-charged us when he was, and one was openly surly at the suggestion that we might give him some business. Increasingly disheartened and desperate, necessity birthed inspiration, and we hatched the seemingly ‘impossible’ plan—we would build a boning room right on our own farm.

    There was no chance to give him one single constructive comment, the poor bastard, and I naturally never heard from him again. In all fairness what I should have done, but at the time did not, was tell him that my very own menus had offered a similar lineup only a handful of years prior. Hell, as a young chef in the early nineties I was living in Innisfail (arguably the coral trout capital of Australia) and writing menus with atlantic salmon from Tassie because according to the Gourmet Traveller it was the latest great thing and like many young chefs I wanted to be doing the same as all the other cool chefs.

    One of the things James said to me during that schooling I gave him was something I already knew. Where fish choice is concerned our menus are constantly driven by consistent supply. Chefs want to write menus that contain fish they know they can get tomorrow, next week or even next month. While logistically understandable, when the industry is so often dictated by terms and phrases like ‘locavore’ and ‘paddock to plate’ why is there almost no mention ever of ‘bay to bistro’. In south-east Queensland that requirement for consistent supply has led to a situation where the fish represented on our menus are largely from somewhere else. ‘Snapper’ could be pinky snapper imported from New Zealand or goldband snapper from the Territory. Then of course there is atlantic salmon from Tassie or New Zealand while your barramundi could be from Queensland, but is just as likely to come from Western Australia, and on top of that it could be farmed or wild and you may be none the wiser.

    The next piece of the puzzle was funding—we turned to our growing community of ethical omnivores. We put up a campaign on the Australian crowd-funding site Pozible seeking $21,450 to build our boning room from a converted 40-foot refrigerated container. After hitting our target on Day 19, we went on to raise a total of $27,570 from 166 wonderful supporters. We attribute the success of our campaign to the rapidly growing population of eaters, keen to be more connected to their food.

    On the 21st of January 2014, PrimeSafe came and inspected our newly completed butcher’s shop, and gave us the stamp of approval. Stuart had done the entire fit out himself except for the compressor in the cool room and the wiring, and we filled it with entirely secondhand equipment. The next day I commenced cutting up my first four carcasses for our regular monthly Melbourne delivery. We were in operation immediately, in charge of what a good friend of mine described as a ‘minuscule supply chain’, one that greatly enables our philosophy of radical transparency.

    A matter of days after taking on all our meatsmithery, I blogged our whole story with details for other producers considering a similar move, and a month later became a founding member of a new national voice for farmers—Fair Food Farmers United (FFFU)—a branch of the Australian Food Sovereignty Alliance. Twenty years ago I opted out of as much industrial agri dependence as I could; today, by the same motivation, I am in the exact same place, but as a free-range pig farmer, and a mindful meatsmith. ¡Viva la Revolución!

    Famed culinary sexuliser Nigella Lawson has embraced it. Her bravado in depicting both the making and consumption of food as so much more than sustenance has gained her some kind of a reputation over the years. To most of us, though, the actual reality of Ms. Lawson slowly licking some delightfully rich chocolate remnants from a spoon, or stirring the contents of her pot with her feminine vigor is about as raucous as a Tuesday night on the couch. But nonetheless it forces us to acknowledge a parallel between food and sex appeal.

    Food plays an innate role in social interaction; for those of you with far more interesting lives than my own, you may even have partaken in some food-based bedroom shenanigans. The numerous inappropriate instances involving both strawberries and cream that are often presented to us across popular culture mediums must be occuring somewhere. It is these manifestations of food that lead to the actual point. The fact that a particular food is understood as sexy, cool and interesting is innately linked to our willingness to create, market and, most of all, consume it.

    We want it, we need it, we absolutely love it.

    La famiglia: Many factors were distilled into that 2004 L’Immigrante—including Otto’s refreshing Italian/Australian odyssey. However the driving passion to produce this product was really empowered by Otto’s sons Michael and Christian.

    ‘Family business makes a big difference’, explains Otto. ‘Everyone in the family knows what is going on and they get on with it. The passion that you have as a family is important, tradition is important too and innovation, but family is our biggest ingredient’.

    Michael Dal Zotto is the producer who has studied the art of winemaking both in Italy and Australia and had invested years of dedication into that first bottle, and all the bottles since. Christian Dal Zotto is the sales and marketing brain behind the venture.

    ‘Now more than ever it is important that there is a connection of person or place to product’, explains Christian. ‘When we started selling wine, it was nice for our customers that we were a family business, but it wasn’t a reason for them to buy from us. But now restaurateurs want to deal directly with wineries, and they want to know where their product is coming from’.

    Today Dal Zotto is a medium sized wine producer, growing a Prosecco grape among an assortment of others including Pinot Grigio, Sangiovese and Rosé across its 45 hectares. Prosecco is still the signature product, and can be found at bottle shops across the country, mainly thanks to a distribution deal with liquor giants Dan Murphy’s. Its mass-produced Pucino Prosecco is now made in the more efficient Charmat style where the second fermentation takes place in a pressurised tank, rather than the bottle. However, the Dal Zotto’s more premium L’Immigrante Prosecco’s are still made using the Methode Champenoise, which defined the 2004 vintage. Dal Zotto has also been operating a lively cellar door on King Valley Road boasting a fine Italian restaurant for a number of years. Many of the ingredients served are handpicked from mama Elena’s meticulously kept vegetable garden. Inspired by the success of the Dal Zotto brand, in 2014, there are also a number of other growers producing Prosecco in the region.

    If these farmers weren’t using chemicals, synthetic fertilisers and multitudes of additives to nurture their crops, was it the same for grape growers and winemakers? Over the years of drinking a few bottles here and there with Dirk, a philosophy developed that really impacted what I was looking for in a bottle.

    When I selected a cabbage, did I do so because it was delicious, well nurtured and interesting? Or was it because it looked perfect, tasted good, but ultimately every bite was the same as the last? All these questions and more steered my palate, my ideas and my education toward the opening of Garagistes and what would be featuring on the wine list the day we opened the door.

    The next day back at work I called the restaurant. Not something I would regularly do, but I couldn’t let it slide. The chef wasn’t in but I left a message with the receptionist: ‘Hi, I ate at your restaurant last night. I’m not really making a complaint but just to let you know, as someone who thinks a fair amount about sustainability issues, it is very evident to me that you guys don’t.’ I made an offer to chat with their chef and left my number but to be honest I expected that to be the end of it.

    It was to my surprise and his credit that very soon a perfectly nice guy with an English accent phoned me back. Let’s call him James. By his own admission he had comparatively little knowledge of our local fish but was obviously interested in learning more. Retrospectively, I’m not proud to tell you that I let him have it with all the ‘born again’ self righteousness I could muster. ‘The only local fish you have is swordfish and that is overfished, your orange roughy is probably over 100 years old and from a very slow-growing and venerable population.’ I went on and on.

    Gareth came to winemaking in 2012, making one barrel that became three the following vintage and then dozens the successive years. He previously worked as a research scientist in marine biology focusing on seaweed diversity. Now he farms his own grapes and makes the wine, with wife Rainbo and brother-in-law Kyatt. “I think I am becoming better at being able to let go and feel the wines and let them lead me,” Gareth muses. “This is becoming increasingly important on a personal level, rather than trying to harness or control something into something it’s not—or what people expect wine to taste like from my region or variety.”

    James says that many winemakers are control freaks, but in the natural wine game, wine is just a small part of a greater philosophy. “We’ve had to ask a lot of questions about the processes that we do to get the results we get with our wine, and we all have an individual expression that can’t be replicated. It’s about learning to let go, and understanding that as much as you wish to control wine or life, you can’t. This has come from a history where we’re all taught to plan for the future, and we’ve had to unlearn that and just accept.”

    These creative, fringe thinkers have somehow been drawn to this sub-region and this style of winemaking, and managed to assemble a cohesive cluster. They’re all individually aiming for a harmonious existence in how they live on the land they occupy and with the people surrounding them. But it’s not all chill commune vibes either. “It’s a very interesting community because there are a lot of strong personalities. There’s the potential for conflict, but we’ve all surmounted that very openly,” James admits. There’s a greater ethos that unites them. They keep each other on their toes as to not fall complacent. But they also rely on each other for emotional and physical support, reassurance that they’re doing a good thing, that what they’re tasting is good and true, and a little help back-handing those doubts and anxieties away. Gareth says the high concentration of makers in the Basket Range makes a huge difference. “We’re pretty critical of each other, but in a good way. We push each other a lot. Without each other, maybe none of this would have been possible. Winemaking and farming equipment is very expensive, so being able to lend is awesome. Also, being able to ask a range of people for winemaking advice is just as important. Though having friends next door, with open doors, is probably the most important.”

    The interaction between this Basket Range outfit is almost like an incubator for a greater reconciled community on a national and global scale. “Because it’s becoming more and more diverse, I think one of the biggest challenges for Australia is people getting on together and drinking together. And they don’t need to drink the same wine or have the same political or social beliefs, but it’s quite nice to just say, ‘We don’t agree on anything, but I can still drink and eat with you. It’ll make the world a more pleasant place’. Maybe that’s what makes our region a little more advanced, that we’re always getting along and finding a way to work through differences—which are quite large because we’re all emotionally involved in what we do,” Anton reflects.

    In this mode of being and making, where nothing is secure, risk is high, and uncertainty is a constant, these utopian thinkers and dreamers are pushing the boundaries of winemaking, and life, as it currently stands, into unimaginable futures. “None of us are really making wine for the market,” Gareth says, “We’re just doing what we believe in, and we’ll spend our whole lives doing it.”

    Meanwhile, Stuart and I set about researching the requirements for an on-farm boning room. Those requirements are fairly stringent, and largely obscured by intentionally vague standards in the federal Meat Industry Act, which are then enforced by state regulators (PrimeSafe in the case of Victoria). Our local council really had no idea whether we could set up a boning room within the farming zone—it turned out of course that we could. Other small producers said they’d thought about doing the same, but felt overwhelmed at the regulations and the expense of building a facility.

    To prepare for the building of this room, as we did when we were preparing to become pig farmers a mere year and a half earlier, we hit the road and spoke to the experts—butchers across Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. While their own grasp of the standards was sometimes sketchy, they were running legal, licensed facilities, so we figured they must have some idea of what was allowed and what wasn’t, even if they weren’t based on a farm.

    There were a lot of inconsistencies. Our research uncovered differences in the interpretation and enforcement across state jurisdictions, as well as a lot of confusion amongst butchers about just what is required and why. We also learnt that supermarkets and other retailers, for whom meat is less than 50 per cent of their sales, are regulated by the Environmental Health Officers at their local councils, not the meat regulators in each state. So although the largely unskilled ‘butchers’—or box cutters as we call them (a reflection of the type of products they usually cut)—working in the duopoly are managing the same risks in terms of safe handling and temperature control, they are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as butcher’s shops.

    There has been an enquiry into these inconsistencies and the need for greater transparency in the regulators’ dealings with butchers, but it appears that the government has little appetite for reform in regulation of the meat industry. In short, that meant we worked out the requirements as best we could ourselves. We were left to our own devices with the generous advice of a number of excellent butchers in Australia, as well as with advice and support from the Australian Meat Industry Council (AMIC)—the peak body for butchers and abattoirs.

  title: Vanguard Vintners
  excerpt: There’s something about the Basket Range. This hilly utopia in the Adelaide
    Hills has lured a high concentration of renegade thinkers, who are steering the
    direction of winemaking in Australia and influencing both conventional and maverick
    vintners with their focus, intent, and dangerously drinkable drops.

    copy: There is an incredible energy to this place and its people. The charm and
      enthusiasm of its winemaking inhabitants is infectious, and leaves travellers
      who were merely passing through, or distant friends simply visiting for a weekend,
      quickly plotting a longer stay. This magnetism draws to mind the romantic narratives
      of Masanobu Fukuoka’s organic farming commune. The farmer and philosopher wrote
      the 1975 manifesto on a return to natural farming in Japan, and city-weary,
      farm-curious folk would pilgrimage to his plot in Shikoku in search of peace,
      understanding and a nature-bound life. Similarly, inquisitive and conscious-of-mind
      visitors quickly catch the Basket Range bug. And the Basket Range swiftly and
      affectionately absorbs these newcomers into the folds of its welcoming community.
      Anton van Klopper of Lucy Margaux Vineyards was one of the original renegade
      thinkers on the range. He took the early blows and paved the way for others
      to follow. He’s kind of like The Godfather of the collective. It was through
      Anton that James Erskine came to establish Jauma. “Anton was the original person
      up in the region who started to promote this culture of challenging the paradigm.
      You need a certain type of personality to be able to have a crack at things
      and stand up in front of other people and believe in yourself, and he certainly
      inspired me in many ways,” James says. A lauded sommelier, with a degree in
      soil chemistry, James had been hanging up in the hills with Anton for two years
      while consulting at a winery at Woodside when he realised he had all the skills
      he needed to give winemaking a right hard crack. “Anton was very generous and
      said, ‘Look, in the first year there’s going to be a hell of a lot of outlay.
      Why don’t you just use my equipment? Your rent can be that you can help me’.
      It got me off the ground basically,” James says. That openness and willingness
      to share knowledge and equipment was catching, with James paying this generosity
      forward, lending a hand to Gareth Belton of Gentle Folk Wines and Alex Schulkin
      of The Other Right. It’s this tutelage and support, as well as a shared belief
      in organic versus conventional food and farming, that saw this coterie of vanguardists
      decide to make wine with a light touch. “I really care about what planet we
      live on and what planet my children and my grandchildren are going to live on.
      The more we do now, the more we minimise the damage,” Alex says.

      Russian-born Alex met his wife Galit while living in Israel. They decided to move to Australia so Alex could chase his fledgling passion for making wine, choosing the Basket Range because the only Australian they knew, James, was based there. Alex took his background in biophysics and tacked on an honours degree in oenology from the University of Adelaide, before landing a job at the Australian Wine Research Institute, where he’s currently looking into the chemical drivers of wine texture. He came at winemaking expecting to make conventional wine. “Very little of what we plan actually turns out the way we imagined it. But I’ve realised that if things don’t work out exactly the way they were planned, it’s not necessarily a bad thing. When we came to South Australia, I really didn’t know that natural wine existed. I always wanted to make exciting wine, because that’s what I felt wine was about,” he says. But his perception of what it means for wine to be exciting has shifted over the years. While The Other Right wines appear vibrant and playful, his scientific rearing has contributed to shaping his signature style. “If you want to break the rules, or even bend them, it’s worth knowing them. In certain ways, knowing the rules can make it challenging to bend them because you know you’re going against something. But given a bit of practice, you get used to it. And that is where we find excitement now.”

      Anton’s natural modus operandi is to question and break rules and systems. He too received first class honours at the University of Adelaide and made wine across various levels of convention and intervention for others in Germany, New Zealand and the United States. But he returned to the hills in 2002 and started experimenting. “I learnt so much at university and I’m so thankful for what I learnt, and I understand the concept, but it didn’t sit well with me. I couldn’t really find the answers in my study. So I went about disproving all the things that I was uncomfortable with. I didn’t really do it to prove a point; I just wanted to see what was possible. Once I started doing it, there was a little bit of backlash by some people, and a little bit of a following from others. Some that thought it was great to have freedom, and some that publicly berated what I was doing.” Anton is conscious that the holistic approach to wine and lifestyle that is a common thread amongst the Basket Range motley crew may induce a perception of hippy winemakers nesting in the hills, growing their own produce and living in accordance with nature’s rhythms. But these “crazy cats”, as Gareth dubs them, are at their core scientists and philosophers, critically questioning each other’s motivations and their liquid creations.

    copy: Taras Ochota of Ochota Barrels is also classically trained, having studied
      oenology and worked for vineyards both locally and globally. But he’s also the
      punk of the gang—and it’s impossible to have a boring time when he’s around.
      He’s up to his 25th vintage—the past eight have been Ochota specific—and he
      says he’s becoming more and more relaxed as a winemaker. “It’s basically about
      working with Mother Nature and dodging the bullets that she fires. But the bottom
      line is always remembering it’s only a drink, not to take it too seriously and
      relax. I don’t work very hard during vintage. I like to finish early, have a
      cold beer, and go for a swim in the waterhole. If it can be done tomorrow, do
      it tomorrow.” Taras says that his wine is a product of his own personal tastes.
      And because his friends and family are first-hand imbibers of Ochota wines,
      growing organic grapes is key. “I grow my vegetables organically, so my son
      can go and pick a cherry tomato and put it in his mouth without having to worry
      about washing it. I take the same approach with our vineyards, not putting anything
      nasty on them.” Each maker of the region has a deep reverence for their entire
      surrounding ecosystem—the soil, the people, the grapes. It’s evident that the
      landscape, lifestyle and life ethics of the sub-region has played a role in
      shaping the mindsets, philosophies, methods, and resulting new-wave wines of
      these makers.

      Brother-sister duo Jasper and Sophie Button have been making wine under the label Commune of Buttons since 2013. However, their connection to viticulture stretches back decades, with their parents instrumental in establishing Basket Range as a prominent wine region. They planted out vines in the 1990s, when the farm was owned by a commune of three families, and sold the grapes to commercial wineries to make a modest living. Now the next generation has taken the lead, converting to organic practices and co-farming the majority of the 30 acres with Anton of Lucy Margaux Vineyards.

      Jasper says the Australian industry has a long way to go in understanding the importance between a vineyard’s work in cultivating grapes and the wine those grapes produce. “For whatever reason, it’s a novel concept in Australia that you can grow your own grapes and make your own wine. That’s not something that people seem to think they are capable of achieving.” He says it’s both hard work and thoroughly interesting to get to the point of understanding what a vineyard is doing and how to turn that into really delicious wine. “The world around us needs always to have evolving methods that take from the past and give to the future,” Sophie adds. “It’s within our nature to push boundaries, question techniques and enjoy the fruits of experimentation—we just happen to do that with wine. The relationship of the farmer and winemaker will always be for the individual to question. For what we do, it makes sense to take control of what we can, as there are so many uncontrolled variables.”

      Anton believes that this style of winemaking requires an open and highly involved connection with the vineyard. “If you don’t have an intimate relationship with your vineyard, whether you’re buying the fruit or not, I would say that’s not natural wine. You can’t just buy organic fruit and not add anything to it. So it’s integral to the method that we make.” Jasper agrees that connection is vital in small production. “If you want to take it seriously, you have to have a hand in each of the processes.” James intentionally acknowledges his viticulturist Fiona Wood among his labelling to encourage recognition for the pivotal role growers play in shaping the final vintage. “Fiona is integral. It’s her energy and ideology that goes into the farming. For me, that’s what creates a very unique starting point. There’s simply just no recognition in Australia for growers,” he says.

      This highly attentive, hands-on practice validates that minimal intervention doesn’t mean minimal involvement. This progressive cohort are not championing minimal intervention wine because they don’t want to be involved. Rather, it’s the opposite. They’re creating challenges for themselves that any sensible winemaker wouldn’t create for themselves. This approach is also demonstrative of how far we’ve diverged from ancient winemaking. Somewhere along the line we thought we needed to make artificial additions at both the viticulture and vinification stages to control the end product. “When we started out, the idea of not adding acid was huge; the idea of not adding sulfur was impossible; the idea of selling wine to the French was crazy. The paradigm has been smashed,” James says. It’s an anxiety-inducing experiment, where precision is applied to picking time, while ferments are left to nature’s chosen direction and a little bit of oxygen can dramatically alter a wine’s intended course. “You can control the growing to an extent, but when you’re making wine without additions, you’ve just got to guide it along. You can’t control it sometimes,” Gareth explains.

      Gareth came to winemaking in 2012, making one barrel that became three the following vintage and then dozens the successive years. He previously worked as a research scientist in marine biology focusing on seaweed diversity. Now he farms his own grapes and makes the wine, with wife Rainbo and brother-in-law Kyatt. “I think I am becoming better at being able to let go and feel the wines and let them lead me,” Gareth muses. “This is becoming increasingly important on a personal level, rather than trying to harness or control something into something it’s not—or what people expect wine to taste like from my region or variety.”

      James says that many winemakers are control freaks, but in the natural wine game, wine is just a small part of a greater philosophy. “We’ve had to ask a lot of questions about the processes that we do to get the results we get with our wine, and we all have an individual expression that can’t be replicated. It’s about learning to let go, and understanding that as much as you wish to control wine or life, you can’t. This has come from a history where we’re all taught to plan for the future, and we’ve had to unlearn that and just accept.”

      These creative, fringe thinkers have somehow been drawn to this sub-region and this style of winemaking, and managed to assemble a cohesive cluster. They’re all individually aiming for a harmonious existence in how they live on the land they occupy and with the people surrounding them. But it’s not all chill commune vibes either. “It’s a very interesting community because there are a lot of strong personalities. There’s the potential for conflict, but we’ve all surmounted that very openly,” James admits. There’s a greater ethos that unites them. They keep each other on their toes as to not fall complacent. But they also rely on each other for emotional and physical support, reassurance that they’re doing a good thing, that what they’re tasting is good and true, and a little help back-handing those doubts and anxieties away. Gareth says the high concentration of makers in the Basket Range makes a huge difference. “We’re pretty critical of each other, but in a good way. We push each other a lot. Without each other, maybe none of this would have been possible. Winemaking and farming equipment is very expensive, so being able to lend is awesome. Also, being able to ask a range of people for winemaking advice is just as important. Though having friends next door, with open doors, is probably the most important.”

      The interaction between this Basket Range outfit is almost like an incubator for a greater reconciled community on a national and global scale. “Because it’s becoming more and more diverse, I think one of the biggest challenges for Australia is people getting on together and drinking together. And they don’t need to drink the same wine or have the same political or social beliefs, but it’s quite nice to just say, ‘We don’t agree on anything, but I can still drink and eat with you. It’ll make the world a more pleasant place’. Maybe that’s what makes our region a little more advanced, that we’re always getting along and finding a way to work through differences—which are quite large because we’re all emotionally involved in what we do,” Anton reflects.

      In this mode of being and making, where nothing is secure, risk is high, and uncertainty is a constant, these utopian thinkers and dreamers are pushing the boundaries of winemaking, and life, as it currently stands, into unimaginable futures. “None of us are really making wine for the market,” Gareth says, “We’re just doing what we believe in, and we’ll spend our whole lives doing it.”

  title: L'Immigrante
  excerpt: Otto Dal Zotto flew into Australia on one of those 1960’s flights that
    stopped at ‘pretty much every country on the way’, which from Italy, was quite
    a few. When the doors finally sprung open at Sydney International Airport he nearly
    turned back around. The summer of ’67 was one of the country’s hottest on record,
    and the humidity battering him on the runway was almost too much to bear. For
    Otto, the thought of resettling on this scorching, and completely foreign land
    was daunting, but then again so was the long trip back. He made up his mind to
    head south to the King Valley in Victoria, where he joined fellow migrants farming
    tobacco.

      Despite initial apprehensions Otto settled in well. In swift Italian fashion he met a wife, who would bear his four sons and his family lived a fine hybrid of the Australian and Italian way. He worked hard and soon owned a tobacco farm on a decent plot of land. Yet, despite this comfortable new life, something was missing, something ingrained in Otto from the home he left behind, and something he was not ready to forget. That something was Prosecco.

      ‘I grew up with Prosecco,’ explains Otto.

      47 years after his arrival, he is surveying his grape vines, which stretch out across the countryside before his family estate.

      ‘I had my first taste when I was four years old,’ he continues. ‘There’d always be a bottle of Prosecco on the table, it was very important. When we decided we wanted to make wine instead of growing tobacco my sons asked me what I wanted to do and the answer was easy—I wanted to grow Prosecco.’

      ‘In those days, you couldn’t find a decent Prosecco here in Australia, unless you were spending $100 a bottle. The cheaper Italian Prosecco was very bitter, with high acidity. I kept dreaming that I’d find something better, but nothing came along.’

      Prosecco and the King Valley: The heritage of the Prosecco wine dates back to the Roman Empire, when it was known as Pucino. Today it’s principally grown in the hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene in the moderate Mediterranean climate of the Veneto region of Northern Italy. In recent years the drink has outgrown its global reputation as cheap fizz, and is becoming a cool, relaxed celebratory drink, served at ritzy events in a salute to Italy’s stylish culture. It’s an uncomplicated wine, and its refreshing nature is perfect for Australian drinking conditions.

      While not as mountainous, the King Valley, 250km north west of Melbourne, enjoys a similar climate to that of Veneto—frosty winters, and hot dry summers. The area’s agricultural past means the land is primed for growing, and Australian wine giants Brown Brothers began planting a range of varietals in the area in the 1970s. By the time Otto was ready to start producing, some 20 years later, the region was firmly established as wine growing country. Planting Prosecco however, hadn’t yet crossed anyone else’s mind.

      ‘I was lucky enough to find a guy in South Australia, that had brought in a couple of plants of Prosecco over from Italy’, explains Otto.

      ‘He wasn’t giving it to anyone, but I spoke to him on the phone, and we got chatting in our local Italian dialect of Valdobbiadene, I told him I was born in the Prosecco country, and he was nice enough to give me a few buds. We confirmed the DNA and we did bit of propagation—it took from 1999 and 2004 to get the first bottle, which we did in the Champenoise style’.

      Méthode Champenoise, is a labour intensive, traditional winemaking craft, today only used commercially with Champagne’s and other high-end sparkling wines. It is however, the only viable option for a start-up with limited resources, and was the only method available to Otto in his Prosecco venture’s early days. Despite authentic intentions behind Otto’s Prosecco, it was a massive business gamble. Not only was he creating a new product in Australia, he was also backing a wine that wasn’t particularly popular. By 2004, two of Otto’s sons had left their careers behind to help create this family venture, so when it came to uncorking that first bottle, the new winemaker had a lot of pressure on his shoulders.

      ‘I tell you what, we were sitting here at this table, and I was very nervous’, he recalls. ‘I was very worried about it, because we didn’t know what was going to happen, we didn’t know if it was going to be very good. The expectation was so high, and if it didn’t reach that, to me, it was going to be a failure’. ‘When we opened a bottle and tasted it I said ‘wow, thank god it’s good’ — I really went ‘wow’’.

      Otto christened the wine Dal Zotto L’Immigrante Prosecco.

      La famiglia: Many factors were distilled into that 2004 L’Immigrante—including Otto’s refreshing Italian/Australian odyssey. However the driving passion to produce this product was really empowered by Otto’s sons Michael and Christian.

      ‘Family business makes a big difference’, explains Otto. ‘Everyone in the family knows what is going on and they get on with it. The passion that you have as a family is important, tradition is important too and innovation, but family is our biggest ingredient’.

      Michael Dal Zotto is the producer who has studied the art of winemaking both in Italy and Australia and had invested years of dedication into that first bottle, and all the bottles since. Christian Dal Zotto is the sales and marketing brain behind the venture.

      ‘Now more than ever it is important that there is a connection of person or place to product’, explains Christian. ‘When we started selling wine, it was nice for our customers that we were a family business, but it wasn’t a reason for them to buy from us. But now restaurateurs want to deal directly with wineries, and they want to know where their product is coming from’.

      Today Dal Zotto is a medium sized wine producer, growing a Prosecco grape among an assortment of others including Pinot Grigio, Sangiovese and Rosé across its 45 hectares. Prosecco is still the signature product, and can be found at bottle shops across the country, mainly thanks to a distribution deal with liquor giants Dan Murphy’s. Its mass-produced Pucino Prosecco is now made in the more efficient Charmat style where the second fermentation takes place in a pressurised tank, rather than the bottle. However, the Dal Zotto’s more premium L’Immigrante Prosecco’s are still made using the Methode Champenoise, which defined the 2004 vintage. Dal Zotto has also been operating a lively cellar door on King Valley Road boasting a fine Italian restaurant for a number of years. Many of the ingredients served are handpicked from mama Elena’s meticulously kept vegetable garden. Inspired by the success of the Dal Zotto brand, in 2014, there are also a number of other growers producing Prosecco in the region.

      Prosecco road: While combining authenticity with innovation has been essential in the success of Dal Zotto, the brand’s work in putting King Valley on the map as a unique wine growing region has been something else entirely. It was Christian who spearheaded the Prosecco Road concept, which has seen tourists arrive in droves to the remote region, dramatically boosting the profiles of the area’s smaller producers. Tourism Australia’s backing of the idea has helped this significantly, and Dal Zotto has worked closely with Government and Virgin Airlines to maximise exposure for the region.

      ‘It was easy to get the other winemakers on board, because we all needed something that brought us together and allowed us to market the region together’, Christian explains.

      ‘Sure we’re going to fight for the end-customer, but we all need them. It just showed that a bottle of wine can bring people together and that people were willing to have a bit of fun and do something that is not so serious in the wine industry and try and make a bit of money’.

      ‘I feel that Australia as a whole has been pretty proactive in reshaping how marketing is done in the wine world.’ Some may see a lack of tradition as a disadvantage, but in Australia’s comparatively new wine industry it has allowed its brands to be completely innovative. In turn this allows new producers to quickly entice new consumers to its products. Dal Zotto’s success has been testament to this and Otto believes that the quality of production here rivals the world’s best. In recent years he has even battled industry bodies in Italy so he can officially use the name ‘Prosecco’ on his wine. It’s now ten years after Otto’s first bottle of L’Immigrante Prosecco was uncorked, and although he and his sons are still refining their craft, they believe they are producing a Prosecco as good as anything you’ll find back where their roots extend in the Veneto region.
