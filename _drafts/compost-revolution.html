    We all have a part to play in managing our environmental impact. Rediscovering our place in the new ecosystems that surround us is critical to lessening this impact. With waste, nature finds opportunity — as seen when a fractured pipes water pipe grows flowers.


    Compost is a great example, we have created a “new ecosystem” where we bring products from the store to our homes, prepare and consume it, to wrap food waste in plastic bags, put them in the bin and transport them in polluting trucks to landfill. This last bit provides little or no benefit to us personally, or the world. What if we captured this energy to grow plants that provide more food, habitat for wildlife or filter the air we breathe? Now that’s a working ecosystem.

    We started to work with the Environmental Protection Agency and a consortium of 4 Sydney councils a few years ago, with the aim of teaching citizens how to compost. Little did we know we were about to start a revolution.


    Through a detailed discovery and research process we realised the problem exceeded mere education. Bins are just so convenient for consumers, but they’re actually a big pain in the butt for councils costing huge proportion of their annual revenue to dispose of. We saw an opportunity for a win/win, improving a consumer’s garden and lessening costs to council at the same time, so together we created The Compost Revolution!


    The Compost Revolution has since expanded to become its own social enterprise, serving citizens in 40 councils across Australia. Today Compost Revolution designs, promotes, educates and even sells and delivers the physical products required make composting easy, saving 4.4 million kg of carbon emissions and saving councils over $650,000 in landfill costs. Since its creation Compost revolution has turned over 3 million tons of “waste” into nutrient for plants. Now that’s a better ecosystem!
