  Otto Dal Zotto flew into Australia on one of those 1960’s  flights that stopped at ‘pretty much every country on the way’, which from Italy, was quite a few. When the doors  nally sprung open at Sydney International Airport he nearly turned back around. The summer of ’67 was one of the country’s hottest on record, and the humidity battering him on the runway was almost too much to bear. For Otto, the thought of resettling on this scorching, and com- pletely foreign land was daunting, but then again so was the long trip back. He made up his mind to head south to the King Valley in Victoria, where he joined fellow migrants farming tobacco.

            People are wanting to fly to international destinations for vacations but planning a holiday getaway can easily turn into a stressful venture when the matter of costs comes up. However, airfare can be very expensive. Air fare by itself can kill the excitement. And when people already factor in accommodations, food, and shopping, or any other would just give up and stay home.If you think on taking a vacation that requires any sort of wide planning, such as out of the country or worldwide even to a popular destination in a different state, it is probably going to be necessary for you to enlist the services of a travel agency.</p>

          <p>
            Try to find out which travel agency you are considering is helpful with. Agencies with more extensive (think global) affiliations are more likely to be able to get you lower prices and added favors for your vacations. Keep in mind, however, that just because they are affiliated with a large group does not mean that the agency itself has to be bigger. Common knowledge would suggest that the bigger the agency, the easier it is to negotiate lower prices.
